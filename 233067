Test Strategy:Steps(ITDS)

1.Test Strategy:
   Operability:3
   Controllability:4
   Observability:5
   Simplicity:4
   Undertandability:4
   Suitabilty:5
   Stability:4

2.Assess Test factor that has to be considered for testing this software.

3.Identify the lifecycle stages of this factor in levels of testing,
a)Authorization-Integration testing
b)Correctness-Integration testing
c)Access control-system testing
d)Reliabilty-(to wt extent trust)-uat
e)performance-system testing
f)integrity-system testing
g)continuity of processing:post UAT.

4.Assess drives that would influence testing/Approaches:
h)Authorization-Integration-tester(Quality analyst)/validation/blackbox
i)Correctness-Integration--tester/validation/blackbox/dynamic
j)Access control-system testing--tester/verification/blackbox
k)Reliabilty-(to wt extent trust)-UAT--client/customer/
l)performance-system--tester
m)integrity-system testing--tester
n)continuity of processing:post UAT--client/



Test plan:
1.Test item:(application name)
2.Software risk issues:Security,performance,Testing at the browser(3rd party like Browsers shoot)platform,browser,configuration
3.Features to be tested(user stories):Register users,manager and member function,Admin Funtions
4.Features not to be tested:new version not to be tested(which is not a scope)
5.Approach:Whitebox,blackbox(It contains code and UI)
6.Test deliverables:source code,Test scenario,test plan,test case,test execution report,test report,defect report
7.Item pass/fail criteria:if i find 5 minor bugs,1 major bug,with no critical/show stopper in this case (pass)
8.Suspension&Resumption criteria:show stooper in application/non-availabilty of resouce/when this is resolved
9.Responsibility:project manager,Test lead,tester,customers
10.Staffing and training need: TESTERS NEEDED(5)/area u need training(performance etc)
11.Schedule:2 weeks
